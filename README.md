## About
This app was written to practice elasticsearch with Javascript (in this case, ReactJS).
It's using a sample json, the design is very minimal, and the code is not the cleanest or the most efficient.

## Getting started

You will need to have `node` installed with a version `>=6`.
You will also need `elasticsearch` running `https://www.elastic.co/products/elasticsearch`.
To install the necessary dependencies, issue the command `npm install` inside the project's folder.

To start a development server, just type `npm start`. A browser window will open at `http://localhost:3000`
and you can play around with the app.
